# Project Description
This project focuses on creating a secure and cost-effective platform for AI-powered image processing. By dynamically splitting workloads between local devices and cloud computing, the system optimizes resource usage, enhances privacy, and reduces cloud costs. Lightweight tasks run locally, while resource-intensive computations are offloaded to the cloud. The hybrid model ensures that sensitive data remains secure, as the original photo is never exposed, and delivers efficient, adaptive AI processing for diverse environments.

# Setup Instructions
1. Install the required dependencies:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
